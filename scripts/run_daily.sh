# Runs `cli.py daily` once and exits. The risk governor (daily-loss + drawdown
# kill switch) runs first inside the command; new buys are skipped if halted.
#
# Mode is controlled by the KALSHI_DAILY_MODE env var:
#   dry  (default) -> no real orders, safe to schedule immediately
#   live           -> places real orders with real money
#
# This script derives the repo path from its own location, so it works for any
# checkout without editing.
