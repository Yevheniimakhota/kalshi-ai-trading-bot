# Close-out scalping study (the "buy at 0.99" strategy) — measured

_Built 2026-09-28 by the trading loop (two independent samples agree). Data:
hourly candles for 1,059 settled markets across 15 series + a 2,683-market
1-minute-candle study spanning the full exchange (Sep 14–17). Tools:
`scripts/scalp_study.py`, `scripts/scalp_collect.py`; caches under
`data/backtest/scalp_candles/` and `data/runtime/scalp_study/`._

## The naive taker version is dead — twice over

1. **Structurally unfillable**: when the last bid is ≥ 0.99, the ask is 1.00 in
   239/239 hourly-candle cases. The last cent is never offered to buyers.
2. **Adverse selection at the ask**: buying AT the 0.99 ask when it does appear:
   354 fills, **93.8% win, EV −6.3% per trade** (1-min study). You get filled at
   0.99 precisely when the outcome is about to flip. The same pattern kills the
   [0.97,0.99) bucket (EV −3.1%/flip) and [0.95,0.97) (−7.3%).

## The naive maker version is dead too

Resting a standing bid at 0.98–0.99 across the exchange: **111 fills, 77.5% win**
(1-min study, 6-min standing bid). Your resting bid is a free option for informed
sellers — it fills exactly when news lands (the losses include KXINXHUD index
hourlies, KXBTCD, temperature markets). At ~0.985 average entry that is deeply
negative EV.

For contrast, the *observational* population (bids already standing at ≥ 0.99 for
6+ minutes, not offers you made) settles **112/112 YES**. The market's own
persistent 0.99 bids are informationally right — but that edge belongs to whoever
is already there for the right reason, not to a mechanical buyer.

## What the data actually supports

* The ≥ 0.99 level is real: bid ≥ 0.99 at 1h-24h lead settled 242/242, 155/156
  (one loss: a copper market), 126/126, 28/28. The informational signal is strong.
* The only version worth testing is the **model-gated maker close-out**: rest
  0.98–0.99 ONLY on markets where our own data model prices fair ≥ 0.995 — for
  us that means the gas/diesel ladders we price daily (the opportunity
  concentration matches: ~20/day markets touch ≥0.99 bid, ~2.3/day fillable
  ≤0.99 in our families). The 77.5% fill statistic does NOT measure this version,
  because those fills were not model-gated.
* Even then: fee math needs a 100-ct clip (~$0.07 order fee at 0.99 → +0.93% net
  win, breakeven 99.1%), one loss wipes ~460 compounding wins, so per-flip size
  stays small forever. Paper-log every resting bid and fill for 4–6 weeks and
  require ≥ 100 fills with 0 failures before any real size.

## Verdict for the loop

Do not trade any mechanical version now. Keep the study as a standing negative
result: **the 99c close-out loses on both the taker side (adverse selection at the
ask, 93.8%/−6.3% EV) and the maker side (77.5% on resting fills) unless entries
are gated by an independent model of the resolution source.** The follow-up that
could change the verdict: Ryan's own historical fills from when it "worked" — if
those were on source-locked outcomes with judgment gating, the edge was the
judgment, and we should replicate the gate, not the mechanic.
